# Basic List App
Just a simple list app I made a while ago which has the functionality to save 
new files to system and options to add "to do" tabs

It has a play function which works with VLC Media player and can stream songs from youtube directly to VLC Media player

It is mainly absed off the Tkinter module and its submodules and uses pre-installed mdoules such as os, requests, subprocess etc.
